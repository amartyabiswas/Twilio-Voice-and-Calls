# Twilio-Voice-and-Calls
Using Twilio api for voice calls and sending messages. I used a nodejs server and express generator. Check out the routes for the file system.
Main code is within ./routes/index.js.

### Insert your own api key and phone-numbers with ISD code.

```
Make request at localhost:5000/voice for making phone calls
```
```
Make request at localhost:5000/messenger for text messages
```
